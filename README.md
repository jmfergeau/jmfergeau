### Hi there, I'm Julien-Maxime, or Max! 👋

<img src="https://github.com/maxlefou/maxlefou/raw/master/avatar.png" align="right" height="150px">
I'm a passionate french self-learning frontend webdev actually looking for a job. I'm also a software translator french-english, an opensource lover and I develop videogames as a hobby.

Note that most of my activity is on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/maxlefou) and that I only share here my public/opensource works which are actually Gitlab mirror repositories.

I'm in an urgent need of a job, so please consider checking the following:
